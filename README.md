# NarrativeShortcutLanguage
A mini-language parser for FireGen meant to allow for quick shortcuts

This repository was created to allow for quick development and debugging of the program. All of its contents should be included [in the main FireGen repository](https://github.com/nfranks8036/FireGen).

<sup>I seriously didn't have a better name for this repository. A programmer's worse fear: naming things.</sup>
